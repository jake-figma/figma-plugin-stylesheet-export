# Stylesheet Export Figma Plugin

[Figma Plugin API docs](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/api-reference/)

Runs in Dev Mode as codegen plugin for the current selection, and in design mode over everything on the page.

Generates code for invisible nodes, does not optimize output or consolidate shared styles. It does however, give you absolutely everything we have access to inside Figma.

Feel free to clone and customize to your liking.
